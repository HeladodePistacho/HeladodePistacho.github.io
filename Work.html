                                            A lot of the crashes were straight forward to fix:<br />
                                            - Check the callstack.<br />
                                            - See what is causing the crash.<br />
                                            - Pull the thread until you find why the stupid pointer was nullptr in the first place.<br />

                                                    While I was testing I found that in the tutorial, if you were using a proxy, when an HTTPRequest was cancelled sometimes you got a crash.<br />

                                                    As it was early in the game, we overwrote the delete operator so everytime the game deallocates memory it was not freed but instead set to a specific value. And then we spend some hours looking at the memory
                                                    layout of the things we were deallocating until we found that CURL was deleting a block of memory that was previously freed. And yes only happened to us because we are the only ones using a proxy in the game!<br />
                                                    I reffer as we because my lead was helping me with this one as he had 30 years of experience doing videogames. But it was very enlightening to me.

                                                    The system was not designed for what we are doing now and every new skill makes it worse.<br />
                                                    This is kind of a personal project I have inside the game because it's the biggest paint point for us.<br />

                                                    The main paint points of the system are:<br />
                                                    - To much dependancy between skills. <br />
                                                    - Animations not following the order the game logic follows. <br />
                                                    - Lack of modularity which has lead to a lot of copy-pasted code between skills.<br />
                                                    I designed a new way of doing it but it still has to prove that it works.

                                                Combat Perks:
                                                <p style="font-weight:100">
                                                    This was the most important part, we created 3 new perks for combat, and laid the foundations to the new perks that would be developed in the future for combat<br />
                                                    - <i>Damage and Health Perks:</i> Pretty explanatory give you a stat boost.<br />
                                                    - <i>Phoenix Perk:</i> This perk was meta-shifting because it revives the dragon that carries it.<br />
                                                    Overall it had a positive impact in revenues and in the comunity even if free to play players felt this was to much pay to win.

                                                    Last phase of the perk system, we prepared everything so any squad could create a perk put it in the json and give it to the players to play.
                                                    This included standardization on how to create perks and lots of documentation.<br />
                                                    Also there are some quality of life for players regarding how much perks they have, find dragons that have perks and better UI to go to the perk screen.

                                            We did a collaboration with The Walking Dead and I was the main developer for the skills of the thematic dragons.<br />
                                            We wanted to do something new and added a new feature to the battle system: <b class="thicker">Battle Auras</b>.<br />
                                            Battle Auras are effects that are applied to all the team and last an amount of turns, which was something we were lacking in Dragon City.<br />
                                            I embedded the new system into the battle system and wrote the documentation needed to create more in the future.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            You can see the bunker skill in the gif below but is basically a shield that reduces the damage from the oponent dragons by X% and avoids critical damage.

                                            This tool allowed the QA team to create all the content needed to be tested in the external QA rounds with a couple of clicks.<br />
                                            It was a <b class="thicker">Google Sheets based</b> tool using both the spreadsheet functionality and the google script.

                                            This was a tool that allowed us to test battles easily that came up from a personal iniciative in conjunction with the QA of my squad.
                                            We developed the tool because Dragon City made a shift towards combat and we didn't had a proper way to test battles.<br />
                                            This was a great success because <b class="thicker">reduced the testing time greatly!</b>.<br /><br />
                                            The tool included: <br />
                                            - 3 vs 3 Battles.<br />
                                            - Select of your team and the enemy team.<br />
                                            - Change dragons stats such as empower or level.<br />
                                            - Add and Remove Perks.<br />
                                            - Change the attacks of the dragons.<br />
